# CHILDES_Script
This script was used to extract data from the Brown corpus under the CHILDES corpus.

# Summary
Through UCSD's Language Comprehension Lab, run by Professor Eva Wittenberg, the CHILDES Corpus Analysis project came to life as result of our inquiry on how children come to develop the use of light and heavy verbs*. As we turn to the CHILDES corpus, a collection of smaller corpra, we decided to use the Brown corpus as our sample for our analysis. The content of the corpus comprises of files of children participants and a series of transcriptions that recorded their conversations over a period of 2+ years. It was with these transcripts that we would then proceed to parse and extract sentences spoken by the participant based on the verb of each sentence.Having a large amount of text to parse through, we decided to automate the process of extract each transcript from each participants file, as well as the process of extracting sentences that were under analysis. This in part would lead to the creation of the CHILDES Script, where it would be used for "sentence retrieval" within the CHILDES corpus.
